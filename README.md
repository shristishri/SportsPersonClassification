This is a **Sports Person Classifier** project that classifies a sports personality by taking an **image as input**.  
The system uses **machine learning and computer vision** techniques to identify which famous sportsperson appears in the uploaded image.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The application accepts an image of a person and predicts the most likely sports personality from a predefined set.  
It performs **face and eye detection**, extracts image features, and uses a trained ML model to generate prediction probabilities.
